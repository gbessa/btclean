# ![BTCLEAN APP](bitcoin.png)

It's a Flutter App built for learning purposes of the Clean Architecture applied to Flutter projects.

Basically its functionality is to fetch the bitcoin current price.

The project was totaly based on the Reso Coder's free Tutorial which I think is one of the best materials to learn Flutter nowadays.
